## Commands

-   For a list of commands type "/help" (or "@Shake help") and use the select menu!

## Dashboard

-   Currently there is no dashbord and I am managable with my commands.
    This will be changed in future!

## Contributing

-   Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
    Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Self hosting

-   Please do not host me yourself. At least not now! My code is massively outdated and mostly only works platform specific.
